Hello!

We generally use GitHub Issues for verified bugs and planned features. Please do not submit issues for questions and feature requests. However, we do want to help!

Head on over to our official [Discuss forum](https://discuss.elastic.co/c/apm) and let us know there what's on your mind. You will reach a wider audience, get help from the broader community, and maybe learn how others solved problems similar to yours.


Thanks!
